# G4mismatch

We present G4mismatch, a convolutional neural network for the prediction of G4 mismatch scores. We developed and trained G4mismatch on two tasks: prediction of G4 mismatch score of any given DNA sequence, and prediction of G4 propensity score for putative quadruplexes.
We compare the performance of G4mismatch to extant methods and the state of the art for the task, and test it on held-out datasets generated by different experimental protocols and in various species. Last, we visualize important features identified by G4mismatch to deduce insights of the G4 formation mechanism. 


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
